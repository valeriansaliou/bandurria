**Bandurria is a self-hosted lightweight comment system for static websites and blogs. It is protected by a built-in Proof-of-Work anti-bot. Built in Rust, it consumes only 4MB of RAM to run on your server. It can be included with a single line of JavaScript on your website (9KB!).**

This project has been started after I used another comment system on my [personal blog](https://valeriansaliou.name/blog/), named [Schnack](https://schnack.cool), that requires users to authenticate through OAuth (eg. via Google) before they can send their comment. I have noticed that requiring to OAuth to a Google or GitHub account to send a comment on a public blog might discourage a lot of people from commenting, since user trust in the blog is possibly low.

Bandurria comes as a lighter and even simpler alternative to Schnack, and requires only a name and an email for users to post comments. Bandurria is built into a single tiny portable binary, and is published in an [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/valeriansaliou/bandurria/).

---

ðŸ‘‰ If you come from Schnack, migrating to Bandurria is very easy: the include script and CSS classes are very similar; you could also easily convert Schnack's SQLite database into Bandurria's MySQL database with a simple script. I'd like to thank [Schnack's authors](https://github.com/orgs/schn4ck/people) for their work, and the inspiration it's been for Bandurria.

_Tested at Rust version: `rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)`_

**ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± Crafted in Santiago, Chile.**

## Features

* **Built-in spam control** with a Proof of Work anti-bot system (without annoying CAPTCHAs!)
* **Email-based notifications** and Magic Link comment moderation (no complicated Web admin UI)
* **Zero-dependencies server runtime (4MB)** and **lightweight JavaScript script (9KB)**
* **Compatible with any static website** or blog system (as long as your can add 1 line of JavaScript)
* **Customize it in a few lines of CSS** to match your website or blog style
* **Avatars of comment authors** can be shown (this relies on Gravatar, although images are served from your domain name and cached there)

Bandurria provides no administration interface. It solely relies on email notifications for moderation and Magic Links for approving or rejecting comments. It also does not provide any built-in CSS styles, only CSS classes in its injected HTML that you can freely style to match your blog or website style. For convenience, it comes with an [example CSS](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/res/assets/dev/test-page/bandurria.css) you can copy and paste to start with.

Spam is prevented by requiring user browsers to submit the result to a Proof of Work challenge, based on an improved variant of [Hashcash](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf) in order to [reduce the mint time variance](https://friendlycaptcha.com/insights/controlling-variance-in-proof-of-work-algorithms/). A solution to the server challenge is computed when the user submits their comment. This spam prevention method is CAPTCHA-free and hassle-free, as it should only take a few seconds to compute under normal circumstances.

Upon submission of their comment, the user will be informed that their comment has been submitted and is awaiting moderation. Then, you (the administrator) will receive the user comment over email for moderation. Bandurria also notifies people of new replies to their comments from administrators, over email (if they opted in to receive reply alerts).

Bandurria can optionally show user avatars next to their names, using the 3rd party [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) service. Avatars are fetched from Gravatar and cached in your MySQL database as BLOBs. They are then periodically refreshed when accessed. If Gravatar is down, then stale avatars are served. Avatars are limited to a maximum size of `64KB`, so make sure not to configure Bandurria to request large avatar sizes (in pixels).

**Oh and what about that name?!** Well, the Bandurria name refers to the _Bandurria Austral_ ([Black-faced Ibis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-faced_ibis)), which is a bird that can be found across Patagonia. It emits interesting [metallic sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5iLNFumfFM).

## How to use it?

### Installation

**Install from Docker Hub:**

You might find it convenient to run Bandurria via Docker. You can find the pre-built Bandurria image on Docker Hub as [valeriansaliou/bandurria](https://hub.docker.com/r/valeriansaliou/bandurria/).

First, pull the `valeriansaliou/bandurria` image:

```bash
docker pull valeriansaliou/bandurria:v1.2.1
```

Then, provide a configuration file and run it (replace `/path/to/your/bandurria/config.cfg` with the path to your configuration file):

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/your/bandurria/config.cfg:/etc/bandurria.cfg valeriansaliou/bandurria:v1.2.1
```

In the configuration file, ensure that:

* `server.inet` is set to `0.0.0.0:8080` (this lets Bandurria be reached from outside the container)
* `assets.path` is set to `./res/assets/` (this refers to an internal path in the container, as the assets are contained there; _you do not need to mount a volume for this!_)

Bandurria will be reachable from `http://localhost:8080`.

**Install from binary:**

A pre-built binary of Bandurria is shared in the releases on GitHub. You can simply download the latest binary version from the [releases page](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/releases), and run it on your server.

You will still need to provide the binary with the configuration file, so make sure you have a Bandurria `config.cfg` file ready somewhere.

_The binary provided is statically-linked, which means that it will be able to run on any Linux-based system. Still, it will not work on MacOS or Windows machines._

ðŸ‘‰ _Each release binary comes with an `.asc` signature file, which can be verified using [@valeriansaliou](https://github.com/valeriansaliou) GPG public key: [:key:valeriansaliou.gpg.pub.asc](https://valeriansaliou.name/files/keys/valeriansaliou.gpg.pub.asc)._

**Install from Cargo:**

If you prefer managing `bandurria` via Rust's Cargo, install it directly via `cargo install`:

```bash
cargo install bandurria
```

Ensure that your `$PATH` is properly configured to source the Crates binaries, and then run Bandurria using the `bandurria` command.

**Install from source:**

The last option is to pull the source code from Git and compile Bandurria via `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You can find the built binaries in the `./target/release` directory.

### Configuration

Use the sample [config.cfg](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/config.cfg) configuration file and adjust it to your own environment.

You can also use environment variables with string interpolation in your configuration file, eg. `server.inet = ${BANDURRIA_INET}`.

### Run Bandurria

In order to run Bandurria on your server and add comments to your blog or website, follow those steps in order:

#### 1. Create the SQL database

Before you can run Bandurria, you need to create its SQL database in MySQL:

1. Create your MySQL database: `CREATE DATABASE bandurria CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;`
2. Import the [MySQL database schema](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/doc/fixtures/bandurria.sql)
3. Adjust the Bandurria configuration file so that the configuration value at `database.mysql.uri` points to your MySQL database

#### 2. Start Bandurria

When you are ready, you can start Bandurria as such:

`./bandurria -c /path/to/bandurria/config.cfg`

If you use Docker, refer to the Docker instructions above ("_Install from Docker Hub_").

#### 3. Create a proxy rule on NGINX

On your NGINX reverse proxy, add the following location block:

```nginx
location /bandurria/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;

    # Important: remove the '/bandurria' prefix from the URL upon proxying!
    rewrite ^/bandurria/(.*)$ /$1 break;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

If you are using a different HTTP server, the proxying configuration will be different. Please adapt it to your needs.

#### 4. Include Bandurria on your site

Now that Bandurria is running, we can include the script on our website!

**First, create the HTML container where your comments will be injected by Bandurria:**

```html
<!-- Your blog article is right before that -->

<aside id="comments" class="post-comments"></aside>
```

This container is usually placed at the end of blog articles (if you are including Bandurria on a blog).

**Then, add the Bandurria loader script right before the `</body>` closing tag:**

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <!-- The rest of your body goes here -->

        <script
            src="/bandurria/assets/embed.js"
            data-bandurria-target=".post-comments"
        ></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

We are assuming here that Bandurria is running over a reverse proxy such as NGINX, proxying the `/bandurria/` path to Bandurria's root.

**Finally, in your `<head>` section, include Bandurria's style, which you may customize to fit your own design:**

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- The rest of your head goes here -->

        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/your/own/bandurria.css" />
    </head>
</html>
```

You may copy and paste the example [bandurria.css](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/res/assets/dev/test-page/bandurria.css) file that we provide, and start from there.
